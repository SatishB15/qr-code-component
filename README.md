## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### Useful resources

- [CSS Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox) - This resource helped me understand the fundamentals of Flexbox, enabling me to create responsive layouts with ease. I really liked this pattern and will use it in my future projects.
- [How to use google fonts](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_font_google.asp) - This is an amazing article that helped me finally understand how to integrate Google Fonts into my projects. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept as it simplifies the process and offers clear examples.
